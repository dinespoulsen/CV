## Dines Michael Poulsen - Programmer in training

I am a Dane making it in the big world of London. Lover of the brutalist world and a dedicated Scandi by heart. You can often find me wondering about in the Barbican corridors or on my occasional city escapes to the country side. I like cycling and I'm not shy for a business meeting to the sauna followed by a freezing dip.

For the past 5 years I have been working as a Gas analyst covering work ranging from market analysis to gas operations. Before going in to the gas world I touched a bit upon entrepreneurship and I have always secretively wanted to learn how to program.  I've already found myself a fan of clean and easy readable code and motivated to jump into new coding languages.

I don't see learning to code as a break with my passion for the energy markets. I find it interesting to follow the challenges the energy industry is facing with competition from renewables and climate challenges pressuring for higher sustainable standards. I believe some of these challenges can be solved by technological advances in particular in tech improvements. I wish to become a programmer and unleash some of my creative side and I have found myself highly motivated creating applications. I see myself either implementing my new found skills in the energy sector or finding a junior developer role in a small sized company where I am able to make my mark.
