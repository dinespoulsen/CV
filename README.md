## Dines Michael Poulsen - Programmer under developement

I am a Dane making it in the big world of London. Lover of the brutalist world and a dedicated Scandi by heart. You can often find me wondering about in the Barbican corridors or on my occasional city escapes to the country side. For the past 5 years I have been working as a Gas analyst covering work ranging from market analysis to gas operations. Before going in to the gas world I touched a bit upon entrepreneurship and I have always secretively wanted to learn how to program.  I've already found myself a fan of clean and easy readable code and motivated to jump into new coding languages.

 I wish to become a programmer and unleash my creative side and I have found myself highly motivated when creating applications. I see myself implementing my new found skills in the energy sector or finding a junior developer role in a small sized company. I don't see learning to code as a break with my previous experience but as an addition to my profile. I find it interesting to follow the latest technological trends and it has been impressive to see the disruption of certain industries in the last couple of years. I still hold a high interest in the energy industry and follow the challenges the industry is facing with climate changes pressuring for higher sustainable standards. I believe some of these challenges will be solved by technological advances. I am self-driven and come with a tool-box full of analytical skills from previous roles and from my financial background. I hope to be able take advantage of my analytical nature as a developer and participate in motivating and rewarding projects.
