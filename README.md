## <a name="About">About</a>

I am a Dane making it in the big world of London as a full stack developer. Lover of the brutalist world and a dedicated Scandi by heart. I touched a bit upon entrepreneurship during my studies and I have always secretly wanted to learn how to program. I find myself very motivated in being able to create a product and enjoy the problem solving part of programming. I have a creative side that I feel I get to use when I program and design webpages. Before deciding to become a developer I was working in the Energy industry where I enjoyed problem solving within technical disciplines.  

At Makers Academy I learnt the best practise within the programming industry. I have gained a high understanding of object oriented programming and I follow TDD practises. I am highly motivated to learn and I have demonstrated an ability to learn new programming languages fast. I want to apply my newly found programming skills and eventually become a senior developer. I hope to be able to continue my learning within programming and get challenged in the daily work. I want to have smart and helpful colleagues around me to learn from. I would like to work in a company that sticks to best practices and use Agile work processes. So far I have found myself good at problem solving and debugging. I have a good analytical approach and I am good at picking up new technologies.

I have a lot of international experience and thrive in a diverse community. I bring a lot of commercial experience after having worked in one of Scandinavia's largest companies. I am a team player and I have experience from project managing large and complex projects within the energy industry. I live in London with my Spanish girlfriend and I have been studying Spanish the last two years. I am an active and outgoing person that loves outdoor activities. I am passionate about food and I like to follow basketball in my spare time.
