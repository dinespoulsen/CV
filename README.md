I am a Dane making it in the big world of London as a full stack developer. I touched a bit upon entrepreneurship during my studies and I have always secretly wanted to learn how to program. I find myself very motivated in being able to create a product and enjoy the problem solving part of programming.

I have excelled when it comes to learning new technologies and I have pushed myself to pick up some of the latest trends. I want to stay updated and my final project at Makers academy is a testament to this. The project was written using the MERN stack which I learnt in just 4 days. I want to work with big data where my analytical side gets to flourish. I have a creative side that I feel I get to use when I program which is a very motivating aspect for me.

At Makers Academy I learned the best practices within the programming industry. I have gained a high understanding of object oriented programming and I follow TDD practices. I am highly motivated to learn and I have demonstrated an ability to pick up new programming languages fast. I want to apply my newly found programming skills and eventually become a senior developer. I want to have smart and helpful colleagues around me to learn from. I would like to work in a company that sticks to best practices and use Agile work processes.

## Skills

### Problem solving

 Before deciding to become a developer I was working in the energy industry where I enjoyed problem solving within technical disciplines. I have held several different analysis roles where I had to produce material in often very technical areas. In my role as a commercial gas operator I had to work in a fast paced environment where errors would have an immediate impact on the bottom line. Working with gas markets you are exposed to a very technical discipline and I often had to come up with creative solutions to new problems.

### Communication

In my previous roles I often had to present analysis to management or host internal workshops which demanded clear and precise communication. I have a lot of international experience and thrive in a diverse community. I got hired in to Statoil's graduate program after my studies which meant that I learnt how to navigate within a big corporation. I am a team player and I have experience from project managing large and complex projects within the energy industry. I have a solid commercial background after having negotiated several valuable gas contracts and I'm used to communicating with clients and counterparts.
